    citations: The minimum number of citations per citation node (5-20)


  Factors affecting the rate of increase or decrease in network nodes:
    time: The evolution time of the network, measured in days
    author_time_delta: The time interval for adding new authors to the network, measured in days
    article_time_delta: The time interval for adding new articles to the network, measured in days
    article_num_per_delta: The number of articles added to the network per time interval
    author_num_per_delta: The number of authors added to the network per time interval

  Parameters affecting the clustering coefficient:
    filter_keys_num: The number of keywords filtered when searching for citations (0-3)
  
  Parameters for aggregating nodes within the network:
    hub_rate: The proportion of highly-cited authors (0-0.5)

  Here are some examples of citation networks:
    1.  Characteristics: High cluster coefficient, high degree of citations, rapid increase in network nodes, a few highly-cited authors

          "filter_keys_num": 3,
          "hub_rate": 0.1
        }}
    
     2.   Characteristics: Low cluster coefficient, low degree of citations, slow increase in network nodes, many highly-cited authors
          Parameters:
          {{
          "min_citations": 5,
          "max_citations": 10,

          "filter_keys_num": 1,
          "hub_rate": 0.3
